## FAQs
**Q1: Does this work on groups or private content?**  
Only publicly visible content is supported. Private or restricted posts are not accessible.

**Q2: Why are some fields `null`?**  
Some metrics (e.g., shares) may not be displayed on all posts or locales; when unavailable, the field is returned as `null`.

**Q3: How large can a run be?**  
Designed to handle hundreds of posts per session; scale by batching source URLs and rotating exports.

**Q4: What formats can I export?**  
JSON, CSV, and Excel are supported for quick ingestion into spreadsheets and BI tools.
