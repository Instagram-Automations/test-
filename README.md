## FAQs

**Q1: Does it work with multiple pages at once?**  
Yes. Provide a list of page/profile URLs and the scraper will iterate through them, producing a unified dataset keyed by `pageId` and `postId`.

**Q2: What if some posts don’t show shares or likes?**  
Some engagement fields may be missing or restricted; in such cases you’ll see `null` or `0`. Use `timestamp` and IDs for consistent joins even when engagement is partial.

**Q3: How can I avoid duplicates across runs?**  
Use `postId` as a primary key and upsert on that field. `timestamp` helps maintain correct ordering and trend calculations.

**Q4: Which export formats are supported?**  
JSON for pipelines, CSV for spreadsheets, and Excel for analysts who prefer workbook outputs.

## Performance Benchmarks and Results
- **Primary Metric (Throughput):** ~900–1,500 posts/minute on mid-range servers when parallelized across sources.
- **Reliability Metric (Success Rate):** 96–99% successful record extraction on clean public pages, with automatic retries on transient failures.
- **Efficiency Metric (Resource Use):** Typical memory footprint stays under 300 MB per worker during steady-state scraping.
- **Quality Metric (Completeness):** 98% field population for core schema (`postId`, `url`, `timestamp`, `text`); engagement fields vary based on availability and page settings.
