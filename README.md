## FAQs
**Does this scraper require login?**  
It can operate without login for publicly visible content. Private or restricted posts are not accessible.

**What formats can I export to?**  
JSON for pipelines, CSV for spreadsheets, and XLSX for executives—choose the format that fits your workflow.

**Will all counts (likes/shares/comments) always be present?**  
Not always. Some posts hide metrics; fields may be `null` when not exposed.

**How do I avoid rate limits or blocks?**  
Use rotating proxies, reasonable concurrency, and backoff. Headless mode plus randomized delays improves reliability.
